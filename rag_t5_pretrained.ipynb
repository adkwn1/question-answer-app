      "Full text: Using the functional method in operator in combination with reduce: >>> import operator, functools >>> functools.reduce(operator.or_, [1,2,3]) 3 You can use reduce with operator.ior: >>> from operator import ior >>> lst = [1, 17, 1] >>> reduce(ior, lst) 17 And as suggested by @DSM in comments the numpy equivalent will be: >>> import numpy as np >>> arr = np.array(lst) >>> np.bitwise_or.reduce(arr) 17 You want reduce: f = reduce(lambda x, y: x | y, lst) reduce accepts a binary function and an iterable, and applies the operator between all elements starting from the first pair. Note: in Python 3 it moves to the functools module. You can also use the or_ function from the operator module instead of writing the lambda yourself: from operator import or_ f = reduce(or_, lst) Python 3.1 itertools.compress (or Python 2.7's if you haven't upgraded yet) does exactly that (the list comprehension is a real close second): import itertools filtered = itertools.compress(s, b) Note that this produces an iterator, not a list. Saves memory, but if you need to iterate it several times or use indices, you can always use list(itertools.compress(s, b)). Still shorter. You can use list comprehensions: newList = [word for (word, mask) in zip(s,b) if mask] # Note: Could also use 'if mask == blah', if mask is not a boolean-compatible type. This first takes the original two lists, and zips them together, so that you get a (temporary - this is still inside the list comp!) list of pairs of words and their masks - something like [('baa',1), ('baa',0),...]. Then only the words that have a mask of 1 (if mask == 1) are added to the newList. \n",
